<details>
  <summary>What is a Standard Manchester Terrier like to live with?</summary>
  <p>
    Standard Manchester Terriers are intelligent, loyal, and observant dogs that form strong bonds with their people.
    They are active without being frantic and do best in homes that value structure, engagement, and companionship.
    While affectionate, they are typically thoughtful rather than indiscriminately social and appreciate clear expectations.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do you health test your dogs?</summary>
  <p>
    Yes. All breeding dogs at Heartland Manchester Terriers complete comprehensive health testing appropriate for the breed,
    with results registered through OFA where applicable. Testing includes genetic screening and clinical evaluations,
    with additional testing completed as age and circumstance allow.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How often do you have litters?</summary>
  <p>
    Heartland Manchester Terriers is a small, purpose-driven program. Litters are planned selectively and infrequently,
    with each breeding evaluated individually. Quality, health, and long-term responsibility are prioritized over volume.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How are puppies raised?</summary>
  <p>
    Puppies are raised in a home environment with early socialization and age-appropriate enrichment.
    Care is taken to support confidence, resilience, and stability during critical developmental periods.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do you decide puppy placement?</summary>
  <p>
    Placement decisions are made thoughtfully, considering temperament, structure, and the individual goals of each home.
    While preferences are considered, the priority is matching each puppy to the environment where it is most likely to thrive.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Are puppies sold with full registration?</summary>
  <p>
    Pet and companion puppies are sold with limited registration. Full registration may be considered after spay or neuter
    is completed within the timeframe outlined in the purchase contract. Any breeding arrangements are discussed individually.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is your spay/neuter policy?</summary>
  <p>
    Spay or neuter timing is based on the health and development of the individual dog and is outlined in the purchase contract.
    The goal is to support long-term physical well-being while preventing inappropriate breeding.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do you offer a health guarantee?</summary>
  <p>
    Yes. Puppies are sold with a written health guarantee outlined in the purchase contract.
    This guarantee reflects responsible breeding practices and reasonable expectations.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What happens if an owner can no longer keep their dog?</summary>
  <p>
    Any dog bred by Heartland Manchester Terriers must be returned to us or placed with our involvement.
    This lifetime responsibility ensures no dog from our program is ever left without support.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do you stay in contact with puppy owners?</summary>
  <p>
    Yes. We value ongoing communication and appreciate updates throughout the dog’s life.
    Staying in touch helps us support our dogs long-term and informs future breeding decisions.
