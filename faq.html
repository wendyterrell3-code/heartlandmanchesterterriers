  <details>
  <summary>What is the price of a puppy?</summary>
  <p>
    Puppies from Heartland Manchester Terriers are $2,000.
    A non-refundable deposit of $500 is required once puppies are confirmed,
    with the remaining balance of $1,500 due at the time of pickup.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pricing reflects careful breeding, comprehensive health testing,
    responsible puppy raising, and lifetime breeder support.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What ear options are available?</summary>
  <p>
    Manchester Terriers may have natural ears or cropped ears. Natural ears may be fully erect or button ears.
    For conformation showing in Standard Manchester Terriers, natural ears must be erect.
  </p>

  <p>
    Toy Manchester Terriers must have natural, erect ears for conformation showing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ear cropping is optional and is not required. If a puppy is to be cropped, this must be discussed in advance.
    Cropping involves additional cost unless the buyer has access to a reputable veterinarian experienced in the procedure. Any ear cropping must comply with local laws and veterinary guidelines.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are happy to discuss ear options, timelines, and expectations so buyers can make an informed decision.
  </p>
</details>
  
<details>
  <summary>What is a Standard Manchester Terrier like to live with?</summary>
  <p>
    Standard Manchester Terriers are intelligent, loyal, and observant dogs that form strong bonds with their people.
    They are active without being frantic and do best in homes that value structure, engagement, and companionship.
    While affectionate, they are typically thoughtful rather than indiscriminately social and appreciate clear expectations.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do you health test your dogs?</summary>
  <p>
    Yes. All breeding dogs at Heartland Manchester Terriers complete comprehensive health testing appropriate for the breed,
    with results registered through OFA where applicable. Testing includes genetic screening and clinical evaluations,
    with additional testing completed as age and circumstance allow.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How often do you have litters?</summary>
  <p>
    Heartland Manchester Terriers is a small, purpose-driven program. Litters are planned selectively and infrequently,
    with each breeding evaluated individually. Quality, health, and long-term responsibility are prioritized over volume.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How are puppies raised?</summary>
  <p>
    Puppies are raised in a home environment with early socialization and age-appropriate enrichment.
    Care is taken to support confidence, resilience, and stability during critical developmental periods.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do you decide puppy placement?</summary>
  <p>
    Placement decisions are made thoughtfully, considering temperament, structure, and the individual goals of each home.
    While preferences are considered, the priority is matching each puppy to the environment where it is most likely to thrive.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Are puppies sold with full registration?</summary>
  <p>
    Pet and companion puppies are sold with limited registration. Full registration may be considered after spay or neuter
    is completed within the timeframe outlined in the purchase contract. Any breeding arrangements are discussed individually.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is your spay/neuter policy?</summary>
  <p>
    Spay or neuter timing is based on the health and development of the individual dog and is outlined in the purchase contract.
    The goal is to support long-term physical well-being while preventing inappropriate breeding.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do you offer a health guarantee?</summary>
  <p>
    Yes. Puppies are sold with a written health guarantee outlined in the purchase contract.
    This guarantee reflects responsible breeding practices and reasonable expectations.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What happens if an owner can no longer keep their dog?</summary>
  <p>
    Any dog bred by Heartland Manchester Terriers must be returned to us or placed with our involvement.
    This lifetime responsibility ensures no dog from our program is ever left without support.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do you stay in contact with puppy owners?</summary>
  <p>
    Yes. We value ongoing communication and appreciate updates throughout the dog’s life.
    Staying in touch helps us support our dogs long-term and informs future breeding decisions.
  </p>
</details>

  <details>
  <summary>Can you tell me more about the pedigrees behind your dogs?</summary>
  <p>
   Yes. The pedigrees behind our dogs reflect decades of purposeful breeding by established programs
    known for correct type, sound movement, and long-term consistency. Rather than focusing on names
    alone, we evaluate how structure, temperament, and reliability appear repeatedly across generations.
