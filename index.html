  <h2>Our Story</h2>

  <div class="story-content">
    <p>Dogs have always been part of my life—long before I ever stepped into the show ring myself.</p>

    <p>As a child, I grew up alongside my mom as she showed her first dog, a German Shepherd named Jackie. I was the official leash holder, road-working dogs, watching, learning, and absorbing far more than I realized at the time. Over the years, my mom explored several breeds—Pharaoh Hounds, Borzoi, and eventually Golden Retrievers, which became her forever breed. The show world was always there, even when I stepped away to build my own adult life.</p>

    <p>I married, raised three incredible children, moved states, built a career in special education, and always had dogs at my side. During those years, I fostered extensively—often taking in the long-term shelter dogs that no one else wanted. My daughters and I rehabilitated them, helped them heal, and found them their forever homes. A few, of course, stayed with us.</p>

    <p>One of those dogs was Ember.</p>

    <p>Ember was a mixed-breed girl who changed my life. I only had her a few short years before she was diagnosed with Cushing’s disease and passed away. Losing her was devastating—but she shaped how I see dogs, responsibility, and health forever. Her impact is the reason health, longevity, and quality of life are non-negotiable priorities for me.</p>

    <p>After Ember passed, I didn’t think I could open my heart to another dog. Years later, after moving to central Florida to be closer to my mom, dogs found their way back into my life in an unexpected way. I began attending shows with my mom during school breaks, observing breeds, watching ringside, and slowly reconnecting with the world I grew up in. One day, she handed me a lead and said, “Watch the others and follow them.” I walked into the ring fully convinced I’d help her dog lose—only to walk out with a major. That moment lit a fire I didn’t know was still there.</p>

    <p>When I began searching for <em>my</em> breed, I was deliberate. I wanted a small-to-medium dog—athletic but manageable, healthy, confident, and balanced. I didn’t want a dog that needed to be everyone’s best friend, but one that could move comfortably through the world: steady, self-assured, and neutral. I’m an introvert, and I wanted a dog that fit real life, not just the ring.</p>

    <p>That search led me to the Manchester Terrier.</p>

    <p>The moment I saw them, I knew. The black and tan, the outline, the presence—it clicked instantly. I researched obsessively, studied the breed, watched countless videos, and learned everything I could. I met several breeders along the way, including Wendy Schober here in Florida, where I was able to see both Standard and Toy Manchesters in person and observe their temperaments and ring presence.</p>

    <p>Through my mom, I was introduced to Rebecca McAuley in Canada. From the beginning, I was honest: I was new to showing but serious, committed, and supported by mentorship. After many conversations, videos, and careful evaluation, I chose Evie. And then, trusting Rebecca’s long-term vision and breeding plan, I added Falkor. These were not convenience decisions—they were intentional ones.</p>

    <p>Bringing two five-month-old puppies home across borders was just the beginning of a steep learning curve. Training, bonding, socialization, long drives to conformation classes, and constant questions filled those early months. I leaned heavily on Rebecca’s guidance and my mom’s experience, determined to build well-balanced dogs before ever worrying about ribbons.</p>

    <p>Their first shows proved they were more than just promising puppies.</p>

    <p>Evie and Falkor quickly began winning—often trading wins back and forth like siblings determined to outdo one another. Although they are <strong>not littermates</strong>, their dynamic felt very much like a sibling rivalry, with each pushing the other to rise to the occasion. Show after show, one would step up, and the other would answer right back. As they matured, so did my handling, refining my skills through observation, repetition, and learning from seasoned professionals in the ring.</p>

    <p>December 2024 marked a defining moment at the Manchester National. Both dogs earned their first majors in a single day. Falkor finished his championship at the National with a Best of Winners and Best of Variety Owner-Handler win. Evie earned her first major and Best of Variety Junior Puppy. For someone who had stepped back into showing less than a year earlier, it was surreal—and unforgettable.</p>

    <p>In 2025, after moving into my home in Avon Park, Florida—with a fully fenced acre designed for dogs to truly live—I returned to the ring with renewed focus. At a major show in Louisville, Evie finished her championship, Falkor earned his majors toward his Grand Championship, and both continued to prove their consistency and quality under multiple judges. Evie later went on the road with my mom, earning multiple group placements.</p>

    <p>Heartland is more than a kennel name. It reflects where I live, how I live, and what I believe in. It represents space, intention, balance, and heart. It’s a place where dogs are allowed to be dogs—healthy, confident, and well-loved.</p>

    <p>As of December 2025, Evie chose her next chapter—coming into season and shifting our focus from the show ring to the future. After progesterone testing and artificial insemination, we are now waiting, hopeful and intentional, for what comes next.</p>

    <p><strong>Heartland Manchester Terriers</strong> is built on patience, mentorship, honesty, and respect—for the dogs, the breed, and the generations to come.</p>
