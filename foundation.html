  <h2>Why This Pairing</h2>

  <p style="color:#b7bcc7;">
    The Falkor × Evie pairing was planned with balance, soundness, and long-term breed preservation in mind.
    Rather than doubling down on extremes, this breeding brings together two dogs whose strengths
    complement one another both physically and temperamentally.
  </p>

  <p style="color:#b7bcc7;">
    Falkor contributes strong overall balance, clean structure, and efficient, effortless movement,
    along with a composed and thoughtful temperament. Evie brings femininity, correct proportions,
    steadiness, and consistency, serving as a solid foundation for producing puppies that are both
    structurally sound and mentally stable.

  <p style="color:#b7bcc7;">
    This pairing was selected to preserve correct breed type while prioritizing functional movement,
    moderation, and reliability. The goal is to produce Manchester Terriers capable of succeeding
    in the ring while also thriving as companions, performance dogs, or future breeding prospects.
  </p>

  <p style="color:#b7bcc7;">
    Every breeding decision at Heartland Manchester Terriers is made with the long view in mind—focusing
    not only on the individual dogs, but on what they can consistently contribute to the breed as a whole.

  stability, and overall consistency in future generations.

  <h2>Breeding Goals & Philosophy</h2>

  <p style="color:#b7bcc7;">
    Heartland Manchester Terriers is a small, purpose-driven breeding program focused on preservation,
    sound structure, stable temperament, and thoughtful placement. Each breeding is planned with intention,
    emphasizing balance, moderation, and long-term consistency rather than short-term trends.
  </p>

  <p style="color:#b7bcc7;">
    Dogs are evaluated as complete individuals—considering structure, movement, temperament, and health as
    interconnected pieces rather than isolated traits. Breeding decisions are made conservatively, with the
    understanding that preservation requires patience, honesty, and restraint.
  </p>

  <p style="color:#b7bcc7;">
    The goal at Heartland is not volume or visibility, but quality and responsibility—producing Manchester
    Terriers capable of thriving as companions, performance partners, and future contributors to the breed.
